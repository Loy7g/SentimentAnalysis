Long waits...BUT FOR GOOD REASON. Some awesome Italian food and great vibes. Contoso Bistro always has live music or events going on to keep you entertained. The food is good enough to keep me entertained though!
The Contoso Bistro lasagna is a classic! The outdoor back patio is such a vibe, especially in the summer. Great service as well :) Love this place and will be back for more.

The cafeteria food is getting worse by the day. $15 for a plate of burger and fries does not seem subsidized.
